/*
Ethereum:
     1. Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton 
     state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.
     2. Ethereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts.
     3. Ethereum = A Computer
