/*
Consensus Mechanisms :-
:- Consensus means coming to a general agreement. 
:- Blockchain consensus typically means at least 51% of nodes are in agreement over the current global state of the network.
*/

/*
Mining :-
  Mining is process of creating a block of transactions to be added to a blockchain.
  */

/*
proof-of-work mining algorithm :-

1.Take current blockâ€™s block header, add mempool transactions
2.Append a nonce, starting at nonce = 0
3.Hash data from #1 and #2
4.Check hash versus target difficulty (provided by protocol)
5.If hash < target, puzzle is solved! Get rewarded.
6.Else, restart process from step #2, but increment nonce
*/

/*
:- In proof-of-work, miners must present a proof (in the form of a hash output on valid input data) that they expended energy 
in order to successfully "mine" a block and have it extend a blockchain.
*/


/*
The Mempool :-
      :-The mempool is a place for miners to keep those transactions before adding them to a block.
      :-the miner will take all the transactions with the highest transaction fees from the mempool. 
      :-Then they'll add them to the block and attempt to find the proof of work.
  */

/*
Mining Blocks :-
       :-Block will be an object with a single property: an id that is equal to the block height prior to it being mined.
       :-In Bitcoin, blocks contain quite a bit of information in their header: the software version, a timestamp, 
         the merkle root of its transactions, the previous block hash, and the difficulty.
         */

/*
Block Hash :-
        :-All the information in the header of the block is hashed together to create a unique hash based on those properties.
*/

/*
Block Size :-
        :-There is a specific block size limit that cannot be exceeded.
        :-The number of transactions that will fit inside of a block varies due to transactions being of all different sizes.
        :-For the purposes of this exercise, we will use the MAX_TRANSACTIONS constant.
      */

/*
Target Difficulty :-
        :- In bitcoin, the difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, which is about every two weeks with the blocks being mined on average every 10 minutes.
